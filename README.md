# SolarFarm_OutputPowerPredictionModel
This is an full application that uses Artificial Neural Network with supervised learning for predicting solar power output from solar farm at University of Zagreb, specifically Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing. It contains of a frontend written with React.js (+ other libraries) and backend using Python and Flask server. Basically you can choose between multiple forecast timeframes and then the app forecasts value of output solar power predicted on fetched data from your solar devices.
